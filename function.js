// WARMUP:
// 1. I want you to create a directory(folder) with a JavaScript file, a HTML file, and CSS file.
// 2. The <body> tag should contain a <form> tag, and a <div>tag with a class of “content”
// 3. the <form> tag should contain an <input> tag with type=text, a select tag with a disabled <option> tag and another input tag with the type=submit
